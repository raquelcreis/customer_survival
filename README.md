# Customer Survival - Churn Prediction

***

Churn rate is an essential metric to provides clarity on how well the business is retaining customers. An explicit customer churn represents the rate at which your customers are cancelling their subscriptions. On the other hand, an implicit churn is a common situation when it comes to retail selling. It's basically when the churner stops using the business or platform. In some cases, the customer don't even know they are churning.


The purpose of this notebook is trying to predict users who will churn by checking previous historical data. I hope this analysis help to increase the customer retention in your business! ðŸš€ 

So let's get started ðŸ¤“

## Dataset

The dataset has 104103 entries and 3 columns : uuid, date and event. There aren't non-null values and data type for all columns is object. 
The column uuid has 1034 unique values and events has 3 categories : contact, small purchase and big purchase.

## Datetime Information

As the date is stored as an object, it is necessary to change it to date-time format. Therefore, more info can be extracted from the date column, such as month, year, week, etc.

The plot of events by month-year can be seen in the picture below:

## Cut Off Date

It is not explicit how long it takes for a customer to become a churner. To define this period of time of inactivity that determines if a customer is a churner or not, first we have to calculate the interval in days between events.

Based on the values found in the picture above, we'll calculate for a range of intervals how many false positive will have for each value.

For this dataset, we'll choose 90 days of inactivity to classify a customer as churner.

## Feature Engineering

- First, the column events will be transformed categorical to numeric. 'contact' as 1, 'small_purchase' as 2 and 'big_purchase' as 3. 

- Created column 'eventNumber' to show the sequence of events per user.

- Created column 'numEventsMonth' to count events per month and user.

- Created column 'purchaseMonth' to count purchase events per month and user.

- Created column 'contactMonth' to count contact events per month and user.

- Created column 'numEventsLast7D' to count contact events on the last 7 days

## Churn Classification

Since there are many rows per user, we won't classify a user as churner but an event

If it is not the last event of the user,that means he did not churn in this date range (he returned to the platform, he was an active user).
The last events are the ones that we are not sure if will be a churn event and this customer won't return.
Therefore, all the events that are not the last will be classified as 0 (it is not a churn event). In constrast, the model will predict if the last event is a churn event or not.
